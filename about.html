        I'm Eunice, and I am a second year student at Northeastern 
        University studying computer science and biology. My interests lie in genetics research, 
        medical software, and biotechnology, and I hope to pursue a career in building 
        software to aid in the innovation of medicine, healthcare, and biological research.

        I have primarily worked in Java throughout my courses at Northeastern, but also have 
        experience working with SQL, Python, and HTML/CSS/Javascript either in addtional courses
        or individual endeavors (Advent of Code, coding this Website). I also serve as a teaching
        assistant for the Fundamentals of Computer Science I course at Northeastern, where I 
        instruct students on core coding principles and grade homework + exams in Racket.

        Outside of my academics, I play clarinet in the Northeastern University Concert Band and 
        Northeastern University Pep Band, serving as events coordinator and clarinet section leader
        respectively. I am also involved in Northeastern's Women in Technology club as the outreach 
        Co-chair, where we hold tech talks, workshops, and social events to create a supportive communityu
        of women in technology. In my free time, I love solving puzzles, playing music, going on late night 
        runs, and spending time with family and friends.
