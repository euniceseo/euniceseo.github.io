            my name is Eunice Koo, and I'm a 2nd year student at Northeastern University studying

        <h3 class="about">
            My interests lie in computational biology, bioinformatics, and software and algorithm 
            development, and I hope to pursue a career in using technology to facilitate the innovation of science.
            I have primarily worked in Java throughout my courses at Northeastern, but also have 
            experience working with SQL, Python, and HTML/CSS/Javascript either in addtional courses
            or individual endeavors. In my free time, I love playing music, solving puzzles, 
            going on runs, and spending time with family and friends.

            <p class="marble">
                This marble solitaire game was made for Northeastern's Object Oriented Design course. Java and JUnit testing were utilized.
                It features three possible game modes, and when a player
                starts the game they are presented with an initial board in which they can enter
                to and from coordinates to make moves and play the game from the command line. Invalid moves
                and scores are notified to the user. The game is over
                when there are no more possible moves left, and the objective of the game is to
                clear as many marbles as possible.

                This image processing software was made for Northeastern's Object Oriented Design course. Java, JUnit testing, and Java Swing were utilized.
                The software features 7+ image transformations users can perform on an image alongside loading and saving
                an image from their desktop. After each transformation, the transformed image alongside a histogram of
                the red, green, blue, and average values are shown.

            </h3>

            <p class="hospital">
                This hospital database management software was made for Northeastern's Database Design course. 
                SQL was used to create and manipulate the databases, and routes were written in Python.
                Alongside those languages, the software was made with the use of Flask, Docker, AppSmith,
                and ngrok.
                The software features 4 pages with actions to facilitate hospital administration for 
                physicians, patients, and administrators. Some of the possible actions include viewing patient records,
                updating availability, and viewing patient and insurance information.

            <p class="messageboard">
                This message board I made with the use of Flask in python and the pythonanywhere platform:
                the framework was written with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the route was written in Python.
                It features a form where you can post discussion comments and messages, and the form restricts
                you from posting an empty comment, a comment longer than 128 characters, or a comment that
                contains an inappropriate word.

            </h3>

            <p class="floodit">
                This flood it game was made for Northeastern's Fundamentals of Computer Science 2 course. Java, Java testing, and Java Random were utilized.
                The aim of the game is to get the entire board to be in one color in the given amount of moves possible.
                When a color is clicked, the board features a waterfall effect to fill the board with the clicked color
                if all the surrounding colors are the same. The game generates a random board everytime, keeps score,
                and has a timer to keep track of game time.
