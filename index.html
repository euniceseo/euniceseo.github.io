            my name is Eunice Koo, I am currently a third-year student studying computer science and biology.

            about me:
        </h1>

        <h3 class="about">
            I am currently a student at Northeastern University, located in Bosotn, MA. I just wrapped up a 6-month
            co-op experience on the bioinformatics team at the BioMicro Center, a core facility under the Koch 
            Institute For Integrative Cancer Research at MIT, where I was exposed to what bioinformatics looks like in a 
            major research setting. I'm currently working, assisting with computational proteomics research at the Slavov Lab, 
            and will be working as a Computational co-op at Parallel Squared Technology Institutute starting July.

        </h3>
        <h3 class="about">
            I've always been intrigued by how the human body is wired and am particularly interested in genetics, proteomics, translational
            sciences, and immunology. I also love solving puzzles, and the problem-solving aspect of computer science is what drew me to pursue
            it further. I want to pursue a career that will allow me to utilize my love for solving puzzles in a biological setting, and
            allow me to contribute to larger projects to further the innovation of science. 
        </h3>
        <h3 class="about">
            When I'm not coding or reading scientific papers, I love playing clarinet in various performing arts organizations on campus, 
            going on bike rides across Boston, reading memoirs, chasing sunsets, and taking pictures of the things I love.

            <p class="marble">
                This marble solitaire game was made for Northeastern's Object Oriented Design course. Java and JUnit testing were utilized.
                It features three possible game modes playable from the command line with a multitude of options. Invalid moves
                and scores are notified to the user, and the game is over
                when there are no more possible moves left. The objective of the game is to
                clear as many marbles as possible.

                This image processing software was made for Northeastern's Object Oriented Design course. Java, JUnit testing, and Java Swing were utilized.
                The software features 7+ image transformations users can perform on an image alongside loading and saving
                an image from their desktop. After each transformation, the transformed image alongside a histogram of
                the red, green, blue, and average values are shown.

            <p class="hospital">
                This hospital database management software was made for Northeastern's Database Design course. 
                SQL was used to create and manipulate the databases, and routes were written in Python.
                Alongside those languages, the software was made with the use of Flask, Docker, AppSmith,
                and ngrok.
                The software features 4 pages with actions to facilitate hospital administration for 
                physicians, patients, and administrators. Some of the possible actions include viewing patient records,
                updating availability, and viewing patient and insurance information.

            <p class="messageboard">
                This message board I made with the use of Flask in python and the pythonanywhere platform:
                the framework was written with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the route was written in Python.
                It features a form where you can post discussion comments and messages, and the form restricts
                you from posting an empty comment, a comment longer than 128 characters, or a comment that
                contains an inappropriate word.

                FloodIt Game
            </h3>

            <p class="floodit">
                This flood it game was made for Northeastern's Fundamentals of Computer Science 2 course. Java, Java testing, and Java Random were utilized.
                The aim of the game is to get the entire board to be in one color in the given amount of moves possible.
                When a color is clicked, the board features a waterfall effect to fill the board with the clicked color
                if all the surrounding colors are the same. The game generates a random board everytime, keeps score,
                and has a timer to keep track of game time.
