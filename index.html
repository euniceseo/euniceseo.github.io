        <h3>
        My interests lie in genetics research, 
        medical software, and biotechnology, and I hope to pursue a career in building 
        software to aid in the innovation of medicine, healthcare, and biological research. I have primarily worked in Java throughout my courses at Northeastern, but also have 
        experience working with SQL, Python, and HTML/CSS/Javascript either in addtional courses
        or individual endeavors. Outside of academics, I love playing music, solving puzzles, going on late night 
        runs, and spending time with family and friends.
