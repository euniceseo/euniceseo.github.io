        <h3>
            My interests lie in genetics research, 
            medical software, and biotechnology, and I hope to pursue a career in building 
            software to facilitate the innovation of medicine, healthcare, and biological research.
            I have primarily worked in Java throughout my courses at Northeastern, but also have 
            experience working with SQL, Python, and HTML/CSS/Javascript either in addtional courses
            or individual endeavors. In my free time, I love playing music, solving puzzles, 
            going on runs, and spending time with family and friends.

            Marble Solitaire
        </h3>

        <p class="marble">
            This marble solitaire game was made in Java for Northeastern's CS 3500 course.
            It features three possible game modes you can choose from, and when a player
            starts the game they are presented with an initial board in which they can enter
            to and from coordinates to make moves and play the game. The game is over
            when there are no more possible moves left, and the objective of the game is to
            clear as many marbles as possible.
